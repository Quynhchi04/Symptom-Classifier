## üß© Entity Annotation

### What are **Entities**?

Entities refer to important health-related keywords or phrases detected from the image context or user query. Examples include:

* **Symptoms**: ("rash", "swelling", "redness")
* **Conditions**: ("eczema", "psoriasis")
* **Body parts**: ("arm", "leg", "chest")
* **Time expressions**: ("since morning", "for two days")
* **Care terms**: ("apply cream", "rest")
* **Medication names**: ("hydrocortisone", "antibiotic")

### üìù Guidelines

* Use **exact phrases** detected from the image or user input.
* Be specific; do not include generic words like ‚Äúpain‚Äù or ‚Äúfeel‚Äù on their own.
* Always use **lowercase** unless it‚Äôs a proper noun (e.g., ‚ÄúPsoriasis‚Äù).
